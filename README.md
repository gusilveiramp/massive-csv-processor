# Massive CSV Processor ðŸš€ â€“ High-Volume, Real-Time CSV Import System

A scalable and high-performance full-stack system designed for **massive CSV file processing**. Capable of handling **millions of rows**, this solution leverages **NestJS**, **BullMQ**, **Redis**, and **PostgreSQL** on the backend, combined with a **React Native mobile client** for real-time monitoring via **WebSocket**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- **Handles multiple concurrent CSV uploads**
- **Background queue-based processing with horizontal scalability**
- **Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket**
- **Optimized mobile rendering for large datasets (infinite scroll with FlatList tuning)**

## ðŸ“‚ Monorepo Structure

This monorepo contains two projects:

- [`api`](./api): Backend API built with **NestJS**, **PostgreSQL**, **Prisma**, **Redis**, and **BullMQ**.
- [`mobile`](./mobile): Mobile app built with **React Native**, using **Expo**, and **WebSocket** support for real-time progress tracking.

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

### 1. Backend (NestJS)

From the root folder, navigate to the `api/` project:

```bash
cd api
```

Then follow the steps in its [README.md](./api/README.md) to:

1. Install dependencies

2. Set up the `.env` file

3. Start Redis and PostgreSQL using Docker

4. Run database migrations

5. Start the server

### 2. Mobile App (React Native with Expo)

From the root folder, navigate to the `mobile/` project:

```bash
cd mobile
```

Then follow the steps in its [README.md](./mobile/README.md) to:

1. Install dependencies

2. Configure the .env file with the API base URL

3. Start the Expo development server

4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

5. Upload a CSV file and watch the real-time processing progress

## ðŸŽ¬ Quick Demo (No Audio)
